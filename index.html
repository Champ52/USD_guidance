            <h3  id="sec_03">Section-3: Terminologies</h3>
            <p></p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Official Transcript:</b> Attested xerox copies of original transcript. Xeroxed copies shall be attested by officers from ECD (Exam Control Division). The verification process occurs by attesting the xeroxed documents and the service must have been available in your institution without any trouble. The attested documents thus collected are now your official documents (official transcript or official degree certificate).</li>
                <li><b>Un-official Transcript:</b> Transcript copies you scanned, xeroxed or captured yourself. Take a pictures from cellphone, that's it.</li>
                <li><b>Degree Certificate:</b> It's a graduation certificate provided in convocation ceremony. TU usually organizes convocation in December. You can apply for the provisional degree certificate if you need one earlier. However, transcript should be collected prior to applying for provisional degree certificate.</li>
                <li><b>WES/Grade Evaluation:</b> Evaluation of your transcript and degree certificate by WES organization. It's a third party service provider. It evaluates your academics and gives the report, which later is recognized by foreign universities. Some of the foreign universities require WES evaluation report as a part of application process.</li>
                <li><b>In-state tuition fee:</b> This is usually for US residents. Fee is lower for students of the state where university lies. We are not eligible for in-state tuition fee. Some universities, however, provide admission with in-state tuition fee as a part of scholarship.</li>

Usually you will be asked to grade students homework (answersheet will be provided in most cases) and help students if they have any queries. In some cases (very rare), you will be asked to teach in the class or supervise in the lab. TA is easier compared to RA.</li>
                <li><b>Research Assistant (RA):</b> Assistantship provided for assisting in research programs. You will be assigned with some tasks or research objectives to perform research works. RA works consists of reading papers, collecting literatures, experimental works, writing reports etc. It is little bit tough compared to TA works, yet helps you building your better profile.</li>
                <li><b>Stipend:</b> It's a living allowance provided as a part of GA/TA/RA. Studenst will be paid biweekly for their contribution. Stipend package for GA/TA/RA generally starts from $18K per annum. In average, students gets stipend of $24K per annum. Also, it depends on the universities and school. Students in medecine school gets stipend of around $60K per annum.</li>
                <li><b>Offer Letter:</b> It's a letter sent to students for making an agreement of assistantship. Department/Professor will send the letter via email and student have to return it by putting signature on it. Offer letter provides information on tuition waiver, health insurance, stipend and number of hours the student is expected to work on including the other payment details.</li>
                <li><b>I-20 Form:</b> It is a form provided as a proof of acceptane to admission application. It gives details on SEVIS ID/number, visa type, class start and end date, annual estimated living cost and tuition fees. Getting a I-20 is considered halfway done towards US journey. You can apply for a visa appointment after getting a I-20.</li>
                <li><b>SEVIS:</b> It is a number provided in I-20 form. It is unique for everyone.</li>
                <li><b>Immunization:</b> Universities mandates students to show proofs on some vaccination. Students usually takes vaccination indicated by university and have to show the proof provided by medical officer. Teku hospital provides free service (however, you will need to buy required vaccines on your own). It usually costs around Rs.11,000 for vaccination as a part of immunization requirements.
                </li>

            </ol>

            <h3 id="sec_04">Section-4: Sending Official Transcripts and Grade Evaluation (WES)</h3>
            <p></p>
            <ol>
                <li>visit <a href="#sec_03">Section-3</a> for terminologies associated with Official / Unofficial Transcript and Degree Certificate (FYI: Official transcript is not your original transcript).</li>
                <li>Some universites require official transcript and some requires third party evaluation such as WES evaluation as a part of application.</li>
                <li>You don't need to send official transcript or WES evaluation unless its a mandatory requirement of the university.</li>
                <li>Documents sent to universites or WES won't be returned to you, so don't send original copies.</li>
                <li>Official transcript can be sent in two way: One via email sent from officer in ECD (Exam Control Division) on your behalf using official email id (eg: exam@tribhuvan-university.edu.np), and the email should contain the scanned copies of attested documents attached to it (ask with officer in Room-18 to do so). Second by sending courier of sealed envelope containing attested documents. Students from TU prefer the second option.</li>
                <li>Multiple recipients is allowed with additional payments of $32 from WES.</li>
                <li>I have heard higher than 70% (TU, IOE) would be equivalent to around 3.2 GPA. However, that depends on the grading you obtain in the various subjects. Simply, higher the standard deviation of your marks, lower could be your GPA compared to the one scoring the similar percentage but with lower standard deviation.</li>
                <li>Process of getting official transcript and degree certificate in a sealed envelope.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make a xerox copies (b/w photocopy) of your transcript and degree certificate.</li>
                        <li>Go visit ECD (Exam Control Division) of your institution/university, brining xeroxed and original copies. TU has it's ECD in Balkhu.</li>
                        <li>Collect a DVF (document-verification-form) from ECD office (Room-3) asking for document verification, fill it up, and then go for bank deposit.</li>
                        <li>Get a bank voucher (Global IME / Nepal Bank) from any, deposit Rs.50 per page (get your DVF with you while making deposit in bank). Suppose your transcript has 6 pages, and degree certificate has 1 page, then you need to deposit total of 7*50 = Rs.350. [If you are preparing sealed envelope for WES, then you will have to include WES form inside the envelope. For doing so, you will need to pay additional Rs.200. That is, you will have to pay 7*50 + 200 = Rs.550 in total. *Fees can be updated, be sure of it before making a deposit.]</li>
                        <li>Now you have xeroxed copies of transcript and degree certificate including the original copies, stamped deposit voucher and DVF form (stamped by bank end). Now, go to Room-3 and follow the instructions until you get your sealed envelope. You will get the sealed envelope from Room-18 at the end. (Don't forget to mention/ask for including WES form inside the envelope at the end if you are sending it for WES)</li>
                        <li>If you have multiple degrees (Bachelor and Master), you can make a single or two separate envelopes as per your need for both the degrees.</li>
                        <li>All these works inside the TU can be finished within about 3 hrs, depending upon the queue.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Things to know if you are sending official documents (sealed envelope) to WES:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Not all unis require WES evaluation (some accepts the unofficial transcripts)</li>
                        <li>You will need to create a WES account and get the WES registration number (WES number) prior to getting a sealed envelope.</li>
                        <li>WES number can be obtained even without a payment to WES, go to IME transfer option for that (you may later pay for it differently as per your convinience, that is using the card details)</li>
                        <li>Fill up WES form (which reads <a href="https://www.dochub.com/fillable-form/7475-wes-academic-records-request-form-canada-pdf">Academic Records Request Form</a>) from your side, and ask officer in ECD to fill the rest (sample in the link is provided for your reference only, you may get that form from WES official site). This WES form shall be included inside the sealed envelope. TU will charge you additional Rs.200 for doing so.</li>
                        <li>If you have multiple degrees (Bachelor & Master) to be evaluated together then, you will need to send them in a single envelope. Also, the payment to WES is regardless of number of degrees. Same payment, single account, even for the evaluation of dual or multiple degrees.</li>
                        <li>People usually prefer course by course evaluation, which will cost $249 for subscribing the package and additional $32 for adding recipients (standard delivery). In total, you will need to pay $271 for sending evaluation report to a single institution/university. Rates as of Dec-2023.</li>
                        <li>Payment to WES: You have three options. <b>Option-1:</b> Pay using your dollar card. <b>Option-2:</b> Get help from peoples living in aboard in exchange of Nepalese currency. <b>Option-3:</b> It is costly, but you can also pay it from central banks (such as Nabil Bank, tindhara, Nakshal branch, or any other central banks). They will charge your additional 18% and Rs.500 as service charge. For paying $271 to WES, you will end up paying $271/0.85 + Rs.500 = $318.82 + Rs.500 = Rs.[(318.8*134) + 500] = Rs.43,222 (exchange rate assumed to be $1 = Rs.134). No need of opening bank account, however, bank will ask you for showing a pan card or government provided id cards.</li>
                        <li>Even the courier service provider makes successful delivery, WES will take 4-5 days to change the status to "Received and reviewing". Don't worry, keep checking the status and you will get that changed in any hours. FedEX or DHL will take around 4 days to deliver your package to the WES office, however, WES will take another 4-5 days for the confirmation of delivery, so don't panic there.</li>
                        <li>You don't need a physical copy of evaluation report for yourself. You cand send the electronic copy as many times as you need, to wherever you want, from WES site (however it will cost $32 for sending as a standard delivery, similar to English test score).</li>
                        <li>It took 16 days for the evaluation of mine after my package reached the WES office. Feel free to ask me if you have any other queries regarding the WES.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Now, you got the sealed envelope right? You may courier it to the desired university or WES. However, put details of your institution/university as a sender, not your name. Sealed envelope must be sent by the name of your institution/university (Courier service provider may also help you on this).</li>
                <li>For making courier to WES, put address as provided in WES form above, which includes your WES number too.</li>
                <li>There is a one agent (I forgot the name of shop, maybe "Namaste") in front of the TU, ECD gate. You may also ask them regaring the courier to WES, they are expert on it. They provide service for DHL and FedEX.</li>
                <li>It usually costs around Rs.5000 for making courier of sealed envelope depending on the destination country and courier service provider.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3 id="sec_05">Section-5: Preparation of SOP & LOR</h3>
            <p></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Surf internet for how to structure any of those and what to highlight. If you are seeking an assistantship, you should be able to research on writing as well.</li>
                <li>One thing you need to know is, no one would like to share such things. Mostly, you won't get direct help on SOP, nor for LOR.  The reason is someone might use the exact words, and if such documents/letters coincidently reach to the same university/professor, that would be a work of unethical practice to the earlier or currently processing students. However, you might get many examples prevalent on the internet. Use following syntax while making a google search and you will get results showing only the pdf files. <i><b>SOP samples filetype:pdf</b></i></li>
                <li>TODO: Basic structures and samples will be provided in future updates.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3 id="sec_06">Section-6: Literature Review / Find Your Field of Interest / Course-streams / Related Professors</h3>
            <p></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Letter of interest, labs, research centers, past works and publications</li>
                <li>After hearing experience from others and one I myself gathered, here are my suggestions:</li>
                <li>Mail those profs who have open positions or post ad regarding the positions (don't just email random professors). You can also find the info on open positions visiting the lab/research centers of your interested universities or vacancy ads in social medias.</li>
                <li>When you are mailing professors with open positions, try to show that you have went through their research (just skim through a few papers and write 2-3 lines about that, especially on what took your interest)</li>
                <li>Make your CV/resume best, I have seen many students getting offer just by lying in their CVs, yeah that sound crazy af. I should have done the similar to get into better one.</li>
                <li>Mostly target profs in the following order: Assistant Professor, Associate Professor and only to the Full Professor. Higher chances with AP.</li>
                <li>Connect this person in linked-in (he makes flood of posts on available positions):<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/md-abdullah-083515146">Md Abdullah</a></li>
                <li>Also visit pages such as findphd.com</li>
                <li>Randomly connect foreign professors from your field in linked-in (send as many as possible connection requests). This will increase your chances to find the vacancy post in your feeds.</li>
                <li>What matters the most on 1-5:
                    <ul>
                        <li>GRE score: many schools are waiving (3)</li>
                        <li>TOEFL score: (4)</li>
                        <li>CV/Resume: (5), wish I could give it a 6 (so, make your CV strong, make it even if you don't know a thing, google it and learn the basic terms and intro tough, easy with ChatGPT)</li>
                        <li>Mail writing: (3)</li>
                        <li>Research experience: (5)</li>

                <li>Professors won't have that much of time to discuss with each other on what mails they received. They will be getting tens or hundreds of mails every day. However, avoid discussion with multiple professors of same department if you get response back in your mail indicating possibility of assistantship opportunities.</li>
                <li>Assistant or Associate Professor will more likely be seeking opportunities to strengthen their profile for getting promotion to full professor by contributing to various research projects. So, try approaching them.</li>
                <li>No two professors will have a time to discuss on mails they received in their teatime, nor they want to. However, you might want to avoid emailing multiple professors of same lab or research center, this can cause trust conflicts. Just be careful mentioning/prioritizing professors while applying for the university.</li>

            <h3 id="sec_08">Section-8: Getting a Dollar Card (Dollar Payments)</h3>
            <p></p>
            <ol>
                <li>To get a dollar card: You will need to have a bank account, PAN card and ATM (debit card). Dollar card cannot be applied without getting a ATM card first.</li>
                <li>If you have all three (Bank account, PAN card, and ATM card) you are eligible for applying dollar card (aka virtual iCard).</li>
                <li>Dollar card can be applied from mobile app of respective bank, and it will be issued instantly after verification of PAN card.</li>
                <li>Now, load the money on your dollar card (virtual iCard) and it's ready for payment. For, Nabil users, go to export card details for obtaining card details.</li>
                <li>For a self payment of ets (GRE/TOEFL) using Dollar Card: <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-make-an-ETS-GRE-TOEFL-IELTS-payment-from-Nepal-Dollar-Card-Nabil-iCard">Quora Discussion</a></li>
                <li>Central banks (such as Nabil at Nakshal, NIC Asia at Thapathali) also allows you making a dollar payment (below $1000 at a time, additional Rs.500 as a service charge and government tax for each transaction).</li>
                <li>Payment via banks will cost you 18% more (payment amount/0.85) as a government taxation. Government tax is waived in university application, and is applicable in payments of GRE, TOEFL, WES payments. </li>
                <li>You may also get help from agencies in consultancies, or persons living aboard in exchange of Nepalese currency.</li>

            <h3 id="sec_09">Section-9: Application to Universities</h3>
            <p></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Check on requirement of assitantships</li>
                <li>For fall term, application deadline for most of the universities will be from December-end to January-end of earlier year. Getting your test scores (GRE/TOEFL) by the end of the November will help you much. You will have then some time for approaching to professor, discussion/meeting with them if someone response you back, application to university(ies), sending scores (if required) and all in December or January.</li>
                <li>Common app will make you easier for sending the documents such as test scores, resume, academic documents and all. Send/upload all the required documents and it will forward them to the associated universities on itself. Mostly helpful in sending test scores with single instance. However, it will cut some service charge while paying the application fee. For instance, one uni had a free application fee, but common app charged $50 for sending the application. And in another uni, additional $30.</li>

                <li>Those are the vaccines we usually took in our childhood, however, we did not keep the vaccination proof at that time. Now, we have to take those vaccines again for the sake of documentation. Some, clinics also provide documentation only service in lower cost, I had heard.</li>
                <li>It's good to get vaccinated with first doses at least a month earlier of your departure/travel to US.</li>
                <li>Some universites require vaccination proof before arrival, and some considers doing it after arrival as well. In later case, students take benefit of student health insurance from their university, saving money in Nepal.</li>
                <li>You may visit Teku hospital in Vaccination Ward, it will cost you around Rs.11,000 in total.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>No need to worry about dress code. VO (Visa officer) hardy manages to observe your outfits. There will be a glass window between you and the VO, only the upper part of your body is visible to them. It's good to have a professional attire if you can manage easily, otherwise, not a thing to necessarily worry about.</li>
                    <li>To my experience, it was in the month of December. I was wearing a jacket with sport shoe, scarf and a woolen cap, still managed to get the approval.</li>
                    <li>Be confident, it's not the end of the world. Understand the question and respond calmly & slowly. Many gets rejection who tend to use the memorized lines soon after the question lands. Interact naturally, and it's okay not have a fluency.</li>
                    <li>Students awarded with assitantships are less likely to be asked more questions, one or two at max. Most of such students are asked how did they find their university.</li>
                    <li>4 attempts are available for re-scheduling visa appointment.</li>
                    <li>Not only the login attempts, making multiple clicks such as checking slots on multiple dates, making to-and-fro between pages, reloading/refreshing pages, are marked as suspicious activities. It usually shows a warning in yellow (at the top of Calander/reschedule page) before banning is activated, so make sure you notice the alert message given in yellow while navigating the pages in CGI portal.</li>
